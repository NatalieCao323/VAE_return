# VAE_return

# Overview
This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to generate synthetic stock return data. The model takes Gaussian noise as input and outputs data that simulates real-world stock return patterns. This approach can be particularly useful for financial simulations, risk management, and algorithmic trading strategies.
